Turns out the ants round here are being used for some important scientific research; new technology could be unlocked through understanding how ants carry so much weight, they say. The issue is Barroth, smashing its way through every nest in the region, eating the insects before they can be studied. So, here you are. You've got a target, and you know the foetid, marsh-ridden region Barroth inhabits.",
